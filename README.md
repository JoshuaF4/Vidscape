The topic is about developing an AI system that can capture captions from an educational platform and match them with a user's search query. This AI system would involve natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and compare the captions with the search query. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the AI can learn to identify patterns and associations between captions and videos, enabling it to make accurate recommendations based on user preferences
